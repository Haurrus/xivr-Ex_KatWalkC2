# xivr-Ex_KatWalkC2
Xivr-Ex with Kat Walk C/C2 modules
This is a fork of the "XVIR" VR mod for FF14.
I am trying to implement the functions of the Kat Walk C2.

For the proper functioning of the Kat Walk C/C2 in FF14 you will need to configure the options of ffxiv_dx11.exe like this:

In the game you will have these option :

The first one : 
      * "Enable 1st person threadmill locomotion KATWALKC" :
          * It will allow the use of the Kat Walk C inside FF14 XIVR.
          * When activated you should be able to turn your character in first person 360Â° based on the backtracker of the Kat Walk C.

The second one : 
       - "While checked recalibrate the KATWALKC" :
          It will do the same as the recalibration via the Kat Walk application, but directly in the game.
          (recalibration via the application will not work for that game).
          So when It's checked you will have to do the same as when you recalibrate with the native application :
            You have to stay straight with your feet aligned with your body and your head straight looking forward and then you can uncheck the box.

It's still work in progress !
